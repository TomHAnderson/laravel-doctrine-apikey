This repository provides a driver for Doctrine which can be added to an existing entity manager.  
The driver provies a set of entities which enable ApiKey authorization through HTTP middleware.
Scopes are supported!  This was the missing piece of other repositories which catalyzed the creation of this library.

## Installation

Run the following to install this library using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require api-skeletons/laravel-doctrine-apikey
```

## Quick Start

Add Service Provider to app.php
```php
    'providers' => [
        ...
        ApiSkeletons\Laravel\Doctrine\ApiKey\ServiceProvider::class,
    ],
```

Initialize the ApiKey service for your entity manager in `App\Providers\AppServiceProvider`
```php
use ApiSkeletons\Laravel\Doctrine\ApiKey\Service\ApiKeyService;

public function boot()
{
    app(ApiKeyService::class)->init(app('em'));
}
```

Add an API key through the console
```shell
$ php artisan apikey:generate yourapikeyname
```

Add the middleware to a protected route
```php
Route::name('api.resource::fetch')
    ->get('resource', 'ResourceController::fetch')
    ->middleware('auth.apikey');
```

Begin making requests to your ApiKey protected resource using your key as a Bearer token in the Authorization header
```sh
Authorization: Bearer {key}
```
